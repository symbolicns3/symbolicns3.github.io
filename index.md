# HInterOp

There has been an increasing interest in using hardware to implement network protocols, such as in ultra-high-speed networks (e.g., 40Gbps, 100Gbps) for scientific data movement. This is mainly because the processor overhead caused by the current software network protocol implementations increases considerably as the network speeds increase. However, there are usually big differences between software and hardware implementations for the same network protocol due to the unique hardware design constraints. Therefore, it is critical to test the interoperability between heterogeneous network protocol implementations to make sure that they can correctly interact with each other. This project proposes a new class of testing methods to efficiently and systematically check the interoperability of emerging heterogeneous network protocol implementations under two types of packet parameters: packet dynamic parameters (e.g., packet delay and loss), and packet semantics parameters (e.g., formats and meanings of packet fields), as different network protocol implementations communicate and interact with one another using packets.
